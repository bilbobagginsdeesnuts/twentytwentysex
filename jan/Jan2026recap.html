                by the end and honestly - im down for more of these. Even if it has some of the worst south african
                accents ive heard since mission impossible 2 these are just dumb fun and the guy whose the hulk looks
                like he filmed his stuff for this movie in a marvel cupboard but also i don&#39;t know if his in new

                time by edgar wright. I think he really is missing a lot of the juice he had during the cornetto trilogy
                but i think also thats just that he had better cowriters (scott pilgrim i put in the good camp but baby
                driver is eh and last night in soho is pretty but also fucking dreadful) Glen powell is wonderful in
                this and people apparently hate the third act (when they get on the plane) but i sorta vibed with it? It
                took a while for me to get into its groove but i think the Tv host is wonderful and whenever they show
                the TV stuff its like &ldquo;oh theres the action movie juice he has&rdquo; but also its like purposely
                not always that because its meant to be the horrors of war ok i get it. Michale ciera also steals the
                movie with his scenes like everyone does such a fun job - looking at what his got coming up and ohf they
                tried to make a movie of a book but now theyve got damian lindelof doing if (lost, leftovers, watchmen)

                thing marvel has done ever which is just to say that its dropping you into the world with this random
                character doing their own things and also it feels like a new hotshot writer has come in angry at
                someone elses decisions from 13 years ago and wanted to redeem a character (iron man 3). I sorta get why
                this show wouldve felt ripe for the tax wright off but i had fun</span></li>

                SUPPOSED TO DO&rdquo; and then i remember that i like can make an echo of a lift and i was supposed to

                they could but what they were handed was clearly something else entirely and i just hope they are

                stub to liz&rsquo;s original show and gets it framed with wood from the stage and like thats just sweet.
                Liz;s present is to call in a bomb threat so like they are the perfect freak style for eachother.

            2025 because everyone else was and whats not a bandwagon without me. But immediately i started scrolling in
            jan and was just like &ldquo;oh yeah my grandfather died last year&rdquo; and had a real moment of
            &ldquo;this is just performative number go up bullshit, my accounts on private and ive only got friends on
            there and even then most of the pics id wanna use have already been sent in here and yall are the people i
            actually care about&rdquo; and i call that a valid reason to spin out for a night (i also just think posting
            to insta yucky zuckerberg needs to be fed an banan laced with uranium to shut him up)</span></p>
    <h1 class="c5" id="h.bkgrf75f69wo"><span class="c6">Is my birthday cursed</span></h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Evidence:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2020: car was finally towed away after being crashed into </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2021: northern beaches lockdown</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2022 : normal birthday, my brother gave me a ballon with $50 in it that said
            &ldquo;contgrats on being negative&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2023 : covid birthday, also received a bag full of newsroom redbubble shit pictured
            below</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span><img alt="" src="images/image17.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2024 : not that bad but my mum who i was gonna spend the day with had to be up in the
            country to look after my grandfather, also i bought this shirt and i have no idea where it is</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2025 : the day before my grandfather died and so the plans to spend the day with my
            mum hanging out were squandered as she had to go up and clear out his shit. Also i had to get an JP to sign
            my license because macquaire bank wasnt happy with me but on the upside? I watched the first lotr movie (am
            still yet to see any others)</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">2026: yet again the plans i had to hang with my mum for breakfast/lunch were
            squandered because a storm hit my grandparents house which is now being rented out and the roof was leaking
            so my mum and uncle had to go up and fix it. This isnt that bad because i did go for lunch the sunday before
            so you know</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In conclusion, probably not but im a whiney bitch and im gonna whine</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Edit ive just remembered that ive had multiple parties and so i should&rsquo;ve stfu
            but that was me on my bday so leave me alone</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c5" id="h.a1hr9eqop8n2"><span class="c6">Laying the seeds of a trap</span></h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">So last year a few times my boss would joke in a somewhat public way that im a bad
            speller and that you cant trust anything ive written to not have typos in it. And i didnt laugh at the time
            and did i instead pull him aside and go &ldquo;hey mate im like 75% sure that im dyslexic can you not make
            fun of me for that please&rdquo;? No. Instead I said nothing. But now a new person joined and i just
            offhandedly said it and her reaction was &ldquo;oh my partner has that too&rdquo; so now ive planted the
            trap. I he does make fun of me for not being a proficient speller infront of her all i hope is she puts 2
            and 2 together and goes &ldquo;why is he bullying jack for being dyslexic&rdquo; fuck i should just be the
            adult and tell him </span></p>

    <h1 class="c5" id="h.m74uwprkkhp"><span class="c6">Wearing a tie on fridays</span></h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Last year when we were clearing out my grandfathers stuff i was given the opportunity
            to take any ties i wanted from his collection, i took a bunch being like &ldquo;well i don&#39;t wear them
            but they are fun&rdquo; fast forward to the beginning of this year and i had worn them twice. Once to my
            works christmas party which was the office us themed (terrible theme we all were just wearing business
            casual stuff) and i wore one of his christmas ties that i remember him wearing while behind the counter of
            the IGA. the second was to the opening night of hadestown and that was just for me (actually i did get
            complemented on my tie by the euphoria actres so thats nice no thats not it its orpheus and
            euridicey)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anyway this month for some reason every friday when i have to go into the office ive
            been wearing a tie and i don&#39;t know how long im going to keep it up for but it just feels slay? The
            first week everyone was so shocked by the ties but now its just normal and idk is it as fun if the awe wears
            off or is that when its more a war of attrition of &ldquo;can i keep this up for an entire
            year&rdquo;</span></p>

    <h1 class="c5" id="h.19ff4ddgtfu"><span class="c6">Being sunburnt</span></h1>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hate being sunburnt, i get so grumpy on the day it happens and for like a day or so
            after because its all stingy and like ew. Its also a lot of just being angry at myself for not putting on
            sunscreen and then its just self loathing for a bit. Then if its pealing thats just fun. But i remember in
            primary school i got a really bad sunburnt on my back and that was just so miserable i hate it. The sun is
            my enemy i agree with mr burns block that shit out oh wait i just remembered i was low in vit d in my blood
            test well i hope this makes up for it. </span></p>
